# ðŸ”§ URGENT FIX for Vercel Deployment Issue

## Problem
Your Vercel deployment at https://toolnest-ai-woad.vercel.app/ is showing server code instead of the React UI.

## Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Update Vercel Build Settings
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your `toolnest-ai-woad` project
3. Click "Settings" â†’ "General"
4. Scroll to "Build & Output Settings"
5. **Change these settings:**
   - **Output Directory:** `dist/public` (currently wrong)
   - **Build Command:** `vite build`
   - **Install Command:** `npm install`

### Step 2: Redeploy
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click the three dots "..." on your latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

## Why This Happened
- Vercel was looking for files in `dist/` 
- But Vite builds your React app to `dist/public/`
- So Vercel served the server files instead of the UI

## After Fix
Your app will show:
- âœ… Professional homepage at `/`
- âœ… Therapist AI tool at `/tools/therapist-ai`
- âœ… All features working properly

## If Still Not Working
Try this alternative:
1. In Vercel settings, change **Output Directory** to just `dist`
2. Then update the `vercel.json` file in your code to:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "vite build --outDir dist",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```
3. Push to GitHub and redeploy

Your platform should be live and working within 5 minutes!
